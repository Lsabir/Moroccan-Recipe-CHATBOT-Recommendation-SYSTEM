Add ras el hanout and rub until beef is completely coated. Let sit for 15 minutes. Heat oil in a stew pot over high heat until shimmering. Add meat, making sure it's not overcrowded, and sear to seal in the juices, stirring occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer meat to a plate. Reduce heat to medium and add leek and onion to the pot. Saute until leeks turn golden and translucent, 3 to 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add tomatoes and saute until they begin to soften, 2 to 3 minutes. Add cooked meat back to the pot, along with diced pumpkin and tomato paste. Cook and stir for 2 minutes. Pour wine into the pot and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits off the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook until wine reduces by half, 2 to 3 minutes. Add beef stock, rosemary, mint, bay leaf, salt, and pepper and return to a boil. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 40 minutes. Add parsnip and carrot, cover, and simmer until beef is tender, about 40 minutes longer. Taste sauce and add lemon juice and sugar, if needed. Cook's Notes:   Goat meat or lamb can be used instead of beef. You can use any type of onions or shallots, and try a red wine like Merlot in place of the rose. If you don't have ras el hanout, substitute with an equal mix of powdered spices such as cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, anise, ground chile peppers, coriander, cumin, nutmeg, peppercorns, and turmeric. You could also add saffron and ground ginger. Shortcut: if you are in a hurry or simply can't bother with the slow-cooking, use a pressure cooker. After deglazing with the wine, transfer to a pressure cooker and add stock, herbs, etc., as specified above. Put the lid on and once pressure builds, reduce heat to low and cook for 30 minutes; the time will vary on the type and cut of meat you are using. Once off the heat, wait for the cooker to release pressure before attempting to open it."

Stop about 1 inch from the opposite edge you started, so that the meat opens up like a book. A few more shallow cuts can be made if the pork is not opening up enough to flatten out, but do not cut all the way through, otherwise you'll end up with two pieces. Season the butterflied pork on both sides with kosher salt and let sit out at room temperature for 30 to 45 minutes, or 2 to 3 hours in the fridge. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a roasting pan with 2 tablespoons olive oil. Pat the tenderloin dry with a paper towel. Mix cumin, coriander, ginger, black pepper, smoked paprika,cayenne, cinnamon, cloves, allspice, and honey together in a bowl with a spoon. Spread about half of the spice mixture inside the butterflied pork, fold it back together, and spread the remaining mixture all over the surface. Use 3 or 4 pieces of kitchen string to tie the loin up every few inches, cutting off extra string. Toss potatoes, carrots, chile peppers, and onion with olive oil and salt in a bowl. Place the pork into the prepared roasting pan and surround with vegetable mixture. Roast in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the loin reads at least 140 to 145 degrees F (60 to 63 degrees C), about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and turn roast over with tongs in pan drippings. Transfer to a plate, cover loosely with foil, and let rest for 15 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425 degrees F. Toss vegetable mixture in pan drippings and return to the oven to crisp up, about 10 minutes. Combine yogurt, mint, and garlic in a small bowl for sauce. Remove strings on roast. Slice, spoon pan drippings over, and serve with vegetables and yogurt sauce. Recipe Tips You can use any size pork loin roast. Patting the pork roast dry before applying the Moroccan spice rub will make it easier to spread.Roasting the vegetables while the pork loin rests is only necessary if they need further cooking."

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Spread almonds over the baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until almonds are fragrant and roasted, 20 to 25 minutes. Prepare pastry dough while almonds are roasting. Combine flour, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon butter, and salt in a bowl and rub together until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add egg, oil, and 1 1/2 tablespoons orange blossom water; knead everything into a smooth pastry dough. Add a little water, 1 teaspoon at a time, if dough is too dry. Shape pastry dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and set aside for 30 minutes. Remove almonds from oven and cool slightly, about 5 minutes.

Add 3/4 cup plus 1 tablespoon sugar, cinnamon, egg, and 1 tablespoon orange blossom water in that order to the food processor, pulsing after each addition until mixture is evenly combined and resembles a paste. Remove small walnut-sized portions of filling with greased hands. Roll them into small logs with thin ends. Set aside. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Roll out half of the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface until very thin. Place one of the almond paste logs on the edge of the pastry, fold pastry over the filling, covering it completely, and seal the edges. Mold with your fingers into a crescent shape. Using a pastry cutter, cut around the crescent, and transfer to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Bake in the preheated oven until gazelle horns are lightly golden and baked through, about 20 minutes. They should not get too dark. Let cool slightly, about 3 minutes.

Sprinkle with crushed pistachios. Cook's Note:   The filling in this recipe has less sugar than usual, because the honey sweetens them further. If you decide to omit the honey, you can add a total of 1 cup of sugar to the filling (or more if you like it extra sweet)."

Measure out 1/2 cup spice mix and set remaining mix aside for another use. To make the tagine: Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add apricots and raisins and cook until soft, about 5 minutes. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup cooking water. Place chicken and 1/2 cup reserved spice mix into a bowl; toss until thoroughly coated. Pour enough olive oil into a large skillet or Dutch oven to coat the bottom; turn heat to medium. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until golden brown and it releases easily from the skillet, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until fragrant, 2 to 3 minutes. Add apricots, raisins, and reserved 1/2 cup cooking water; stir in chicken broth and honey. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook until chicken is very tender, 1 ½ to 2 hours. Serve chicken garnished with cilantro and almonds. Cook’s Note Bone-in chicken breasts or chicken legs can be used in place of chicken thighs.For a lighter version, use boneless, skinless chicken breasts or tenders. Be careful when browning, as they have a tendency to stick to the pan. You may also skip the browning and add the chicken after you sauté the garlic and onions. If you make this version, the cook time in Step 5 will be less: about 45 minutes to 1 hour. Editor's Note:   Nutrition data for this recipe includes the full amount of Moroccan spice mix. The actual amount of spice mix consumed will vary."

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a small skillet over very low heat and cook garlic until soft but still pale, about 3 minutes.

Add enough olive oil so the surface is covered and the harissa won't dry out. Seal and refrigerate. Cook's Notes:   You can use mild, medium, or hot dried chile peppers to make harissa. You will need about 15 to 17 large chile peppers, more if you're using smaller varieties. If you make more harissa than you can eat in 7 to 10 days, the best way to keep it is to freeze it in an ice-cube tray, then store the frozen cubes in freezer bags."
